Banking project from CS210

This project was making an investment calculator for a company. This project solved the problem as you could use the calculator to see potential earnings. Personally I think I did great in explaining my code and also making the program very easy to follow along with for the user. I think I could have made my code easier to read by using more variables to hold things instead of typing out long lines of code for things I did not need to do that for. This would make the code way more effecient is someone who is reading it or making changes would have a way easier time doing so. The part of the code I had the most problem with would be using the pointers, but using youtube I really began understanding how pointers work and my weakness is a strength now. The part of this that will carry over into other things would be the object oriented programming. This is because it makes your code more reusable and cleaner. The way I used my code more readable is try to keep extensive code in classes,variables and methods and leaving the main function very clear and clutter free. This means I can reuse these classes, methods and variable later on since they are captured in classes and not just cluttered into my main function.
